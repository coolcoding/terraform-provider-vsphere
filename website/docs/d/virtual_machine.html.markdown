  Provides a vSphere virtual machine data source. This can be used to get data from a virtual machine or template.
---

# vsphere\_virtual\_machine

The `vsphere_virtual_machine` data source can be used to find the UUID of an
existing virtual machine or template. Its most relevant purpose is for finding
the UUID of a template to be used as the source for cloning into a new
[`vsphere_virtual_machine`][docs-virtual-machine-resource] resource. It also
reads the guest ID so that can be supplied as well.

[docs-virtual-machine-resource]: /docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vsphere_datacenter" "datacenter" {
  name = "dc1"
}

data "vsphere_virtual_machine" "template" {
  name          = "test-vm-template"
  datacenter_id = "${data.vsphere_datacenter.dc.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the virtual machine. This can be a name or
  path.
* `datacenter_id` - (Optional) The managed object reference ID of the
  datacenter the virtual machine is located in. This can be omitted if the
  search path used in `name` is an absolute path. For default datacenters, use
  the `id` attribute for an empty `vsphere_datacenter` data source.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id`: The UUID of the virtual machine or template.
* `guest_id`: The guest ID of the virtual machine or template.
* `alternate_guest_name`: The alternate guest name of the virtual machine when guest_id is a non-specific operating system, like `otherGuest`.
